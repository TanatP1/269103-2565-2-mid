3. After one and a half years as an ISNE student, make some recommendations to prospective ISNE students. (Your answer must be at least 50 words long)

**Answer:** As a student with zero knowledge of coding and information system. I had a very hard time learning code, and since coding is a major thing that we do in ISNE, I suggest
learning to code beforehand is very important. Since ISNE is an international programs I assume that anyone that get to study here has no problems with their English, so I highly
suggest that you should spend your time more on other subject so that you can study more efficiently. Some of the subjects seems easy at first but it could be become confusing if you are 
not consistently keeping up so please be careful with them.
